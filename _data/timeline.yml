  description: I graduated from the MA Program in the Social Sciences (MAPSS). My thesis discussess support, networks, and drug use. I wanted to know more about hardcore drug users. About what they talk about. About what hurts them. Who was there when they needed a shoulder to cry on? I spent time and interviewed many drug users. I learned with whom they talk about hurtful stuff. Who drug users cry with. Drug users do not habitually talk to close people. Close people are judging. Close people are patronizing. Distant people, or weak ties, were more supportive. Do not underestimate the support distant people can provide. Do not overestimate the support close people give. Close people are not necessarily supportive. Even when they have good intentions.

  description: The Cook County Assessor's office faced a corruption scandal. To address it, the office decided to create an all-encompassing reporting infrastructure. I was the lead data scientist of this epic. I created a data pipeline that deals with the office's complex data architecture. Using R, SQL, and markdown, I managed to automatize the reporting process for geographies, years, and property types there are; as well as current and new data. The report is a 'ratio study' that uses statistical analysis and other visualization tools to assess the accuracy of the office's work.

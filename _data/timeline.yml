  # You cannot have a multiline plain scalar, such as a colon ":" to be the key to a mapping. A key to the mapping 'description' is the text I wrote. If there is a colon, or another multiline plain scalar you might get a context error.
  # Quote to fix.
  description: "The Cook County Assessor's office (CCAO) faced a corruption scandal. To be more transparent, the CCAO decided to create an all-encompassing reporting infrastructure to describe the state of their assessment. I was the lead data scientist of this epic. I created data pipelines to deal with the CCAO's complex data architecture. I dealt with memory issues by running large data manipulations efficiently. And I wrote a user interface using shiny. I managed to automatize the reporting process and create dynamic 'ratio studies' for all parameters we were interested in. In other words, I produced a report for every different set of geographies, years, and property types. It considered new data in the server. 126 reports per year. 378 reports for the years we ran. Reports allowed us to note precisely who we were assessing poorly. Concentrating our efforts in those cases."

  description: "In 2019 I graduated from the MA Program in the Social Sciences at the University of Chicago. I wrote a thesis about support networks and drug use. I wanted to know who was there when addicts needed emotional support. When they needed a shoulder to cry on. What I found was rather unintuitive. Addicts do not habitually talk to people they consider close. Not when they need to vent. Indeed, addicts avoid talking about important matters with close people. Specially hurtful matters. Close people can be judgy. Close people can be patronizing. On the contrary, addicts spoke about hurtful matters with distant people. Finding support among unexpected folks. The support that distant people can provide is not to be underestimated."

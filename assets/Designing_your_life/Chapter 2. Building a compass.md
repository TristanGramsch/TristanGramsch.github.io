Chapter 2. Building a compass - Copy

# Guided life
Now that we know where we are, it's time to build a device that helps us get somewhere. Where exactly? Wherever the call of life is coming from. The compass shows what calls you. It responds to the question, what are you seeking? Is it perfection? Is it mastery?

# Compass
This is your compass. A few words on where you want to be. And who you want to be.  

The warrior path calls me. The warrior path is to give your life to the pursue of the full picture. The full picture is to produce a coherent world. To integrate all paths. 
To see beauty. To feel a connection with the world.

Challenges call me. A challenge is a hard to achieve activity. It requieres focus. Even in front of fear. Challenges requiere perception of the present. Challenges requiere both mental and physical fitness. Mental and physical fitness are the same. Awareness. 
Presentness. Flow.

Awarness is heightened when your life depends on the challenge. Just like free soloing. I believe that life design can resemble free soloing. You give a challenge 100% focus because your life depends on it. Image that. It is your life that is ultimately at stake. Surpassing ever harder challenges is scary, but delightfull. 

## Worklife
Worklife is a holistic integration of work and life. It is what you do in a give day. And who you are in that given day. Worklife is the foundation of everyday activities and attitudes. It is the foundation of how you treat people. 

To work is to make a living out of your path. Invite others to grow with you. Show the beauty you have seen. Be good for others. Help them find purpose. Stay away from those to whom you are evil. Evil is to produce doubt. 

Worklife is coherent with your past. That which energized you before can energise again. 
Sorrow or doubt might come. Acknowledge their existance. Share it without shame. The things you are ashamed of are small for others. 

Habits are a path to explore new frontiers. 
Reach mastery. 
Be tidy.
Trust yourself.

Chapter 10: Failure inmunity - Copy

# What is failure inmunity? 
Failure inmunity is to keep going. 
Even when you don't get what you want. 
Like a phd in a great university. 
Failure inmunity allows you to keep flowing even in front of doubt. 
You have failed a thousand times. 
And no failure in particular has stopped you from trying a new way to get where you design. 
Failure inmunity is to remember that life is about trying stuff and see from there.

Chapter 8. Designing your dream job.  - Copy

Your dream job is not out there waiting for you. But fear not: you design your dream job through a process of actively seeking and co-creating it. Just as you design your life. The goal is to enter the hidden market where %80 of jobs live. It is hard to enter as a job seeker. But is easy to enter as a curious explorer. 

A curious explorer will have many prototype conversations. They will ask for directions among the locals. And will probably get a lot of help along the way. 
We pursue offers. Not jobs.

To flow is to constantly choose well.
You can feel good choices.
Good choices are engaging and energizing.
They get you unstuck.

Happiness seems to be good choosing.
To always choose those things that energize and engage you.
And to constantly let go of those things you didn't choose.
Unhappiness seems to be bad choosing.
To constantly pick those things that don't energize and engage you.

Choose naturally.
No wrong choices.
No wrong answers.  
Flow trough all of it.

Let go of past possibilities.
Build from what you have today.
Be here.

I used to be scared my imagine wasn't perfect.
I see things different now.
I don't need to look perfect.
My goal doesn't require me to look perfect.
My mountain requires other stuff.
Like commitment.
And constant progress.

You are in the mountain.
Reaching a top opens sight for a higher top.
And it's an amazing feeling.
Of never ending wonder.

# Wayfinding
Ok, so we now know where we are going. Or at least we have a hint on where to go. We suspect that there is a voice calling us. And we want to follow that voice.

Whenever I follow the call I feel immense energy running through my body. And I feel engaged in the activities that call me.

We have a couple devices that help us keep track of the energy. The good time activity journal. And the normal journal.

These devices have helped me to explore with no fear. When something calls I can try it out and note how much it energizes and engages me.

# Good time journal reflection
After completing 3 sheets for the second time, here are some reflections regarding my good time journal.

It seems that what energizes and engages me are people and challenges.
People, because it is easy and nice to interact with others.
Challenges, because they are hard to achieve. Are thus rewarding.  
I deeply enjoy fitness. To be ever more fit. And surpass fitness challenges that seemed impossible. This is not only about exercising. It is also about cold water. About meditation. And breath control.
I also deeply enjoy coding. It is perhaps the biggest source of energy and engagement available to me.
I deeply enjoy life design. It is focusing. It clears my mind and allows me to hear the things that call me harder. Thus, it allows me to follow what engages and energizes me.

Of course, I don't always follow the call.
Sometimes I do things and realize that they de-energize me or that I am not engaged in them.
I have seen myself, many times, watching youtube videos that I don't fully enjoy.
I have also found that taking drugs de-energizes me. I take before I work. I have the feeling that drugs get me going. Nonetheless, specially during the afternoons, I feel it is just a cue that makes me start brainstorming. Drugs don't seem to necessarily make me better at what I do. In the long run, I believe drugs drain me.

A note on time. I used a time tracker to challenge myself. One day, I managed to work sessions of 15, 25, 35, 45, 1hr, 45, 35, 25, 15, 10, 5 minutes. In that order. It was very energizing. And I was blown away about how much I could focus. Part of it was also to control my bladder. Yet, despite the great effort that required and the feeling of satisfaction afterwards, I believe it hindered my flow. I would procrastinate between sessions. I took effort to start a new session. It wasn't natural. My eye was twingling.

# Journal reflection
After a month of logs, here are some reflections on my personal journal.
The same things seem to call me over an over again.
To code. Fitness. Meditation. Cold water.
I also realize I engage with a lot of people every month. And that almost always is in a positive manner.
Close relationships are harder to deal with. The stakes are higher. Feelings can get hurt.
I also realize that I have improved in all things that call me.
I am a better data scientist now. A better life designer.
I am more fit. I have a better work offer.
I invested a bit.
And I didn't even have to try to have better social skills. It is so easy to be nice. Just be present and react honestly to what the environment tells you. Make a lot of faces, it works really well.
I also note that code is my happy place. I constantly note that I want to code more. That's where I thrive.

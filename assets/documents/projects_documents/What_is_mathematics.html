There is no single wide spread definition of what math is. Yet, humans have been able to expand mathematical knowledege and apply its principles to solve ever greater challenges. Here, some reflections about what math is.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
I believe that math is a language. One which allows people to display absolute certainty. About a process. An argument. Or how something behaves. People describe equations. Geometrical forms. Points is space. Forces. You name it. It is mathematical as long as they can display absolute certainty about what they say is true in the eyes of other mathematicians.

Mathematics is characetrized by its holysticness. A mathematical argument does not need to know every outcome of a process. Only the most abstract feautures of said process. Take some data interpretation. Someone needs to know how some data will behave in the future. They plot variables. They draw a line to predict new outcomes. Call it a regression line. We don't know where the line will land. But we for sure know how to create the line. We know only the most general functioning of the problem. That allows us to know the most abstract predictions of it. Math is holistic.

The generality of mathematical knowledge is such that there can be only one complete map of mathematics. One in which every piece of information is the most abstract it can be. That is why machine learning cannot predict new math equations. In math, there is no training data. Just abstract true statements. Competing theories get resolved over time. Math is not a discovery. It's a human readable abstraction. We cannot know if other systems understand math the way we do.

Math did not requiere any given person to evolve. It is bigger than people. Bigger than nations. Math is the biggest entity I know. I can see it everywhere. Luhmann would say that math is a social system. And said system has an important characteristic. Just like a living being, a social system reproduces itself. A characteristic know as autopoiesis.

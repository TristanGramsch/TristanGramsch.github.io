# Host a webpage in Gitlab
## Foreword
First you need SSG or static site generator. I use Jekyll.
Gitlab deploys the website from the "public" folder in the repository.
Gitlab Pages is the server. And using the Gitlab CI-CD tool we deploy the site.
The CI-CD configuration gives instructions to a runner, an application that runs the specified jobs.

## Tell Gitlab to host a webpage.
We are going to add installation commands to .gitlab-ci.yml.
We are telling Gitlab to install bundler. A gem that helps manage other gems. Gems are like packages of stuff that Jekyll can call.
We install bundler, we use it to install all gems we need. And we build the Jekyll website using those gems.
Destination public. 
```
script:
  - gem install bundler
  - bundle install
  - bundle exec jekyll build
```

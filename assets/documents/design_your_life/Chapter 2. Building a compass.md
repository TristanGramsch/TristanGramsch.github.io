# Guided life
Now that we know where we are, it's time to build a device that helps us get somewhere. Where exactly? Wherever the call of life is coming from. The compass shows what calls you. It responds to the question, what are you seeking? Is it perfection? Is it mastery?

# Compass
This is your compass. A few words on where you want to be. And who you want to be.  

Personally, the warrior path calls me. The warrior path is to give your life to the pursue of big mountains. Metaphorical mountains. To find those mountains you must produce a coherent view of the world. One that integrates all parts of it. That 'full-picture' world is, I have to admit, beautiful. Pursuing the full picture is itself a really cool adventure.

Challenges also call me. A challenge is a hard to achieve activity. It requires complete focus. Even in front of fear.

There are many types of challenges out there. Some climb mountains (non metaphorical mountains). Others write great code. The challenges I like facing require physical and mental fitness. They require me to focus solely on the task at hand.

Awareness is heightened when your life depends on the challenge. Just like free soloing. I believe that life design can resemble free soloing. You give a challenge 100% focus because your life depends on it. Image that. It is your life that is ultimately at stake. Surpassing ever harder challenges is scary, but delightful.

## Worklife
Worklife is a holistic integration of work and life. It is what you do in a given day. And who you are in that given day. Worklife is the foundation of everyday activities and attitudes. It is the foundation of how you treat people.

To work is to make a living out of your path. And to find a community of people that want to do the same.

Worklife can be coherent with your past. That which energized you before can energize you again. Sorrow or doubt might come. Acknowledge their existence. Share it without shame. The things you are ashamed of are probably small for others.

Habits are a path to explore new frontiers. They allow you to reach mastery. Be tidy with your habits. Be minimalistic. Trust yourself in the process.

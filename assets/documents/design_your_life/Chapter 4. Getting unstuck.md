# Stuck
You feel you don't have something to do. Somewhere you belong. There is nothing to work for. If there is, you don't know what to do next to make it happen. You are stuck. It is not a nice feeling. Here, how to get unstuck.  

# Get unstuck. Pursue bigger mountains.
When you are stuck you can feel as if nothing matters. What's the difference between going about your day and watching a youtube video? Probably none for someone who is stuck. To make things matter, it is useful to find problems. Problems give a reason to action. But problems are not easy to see. You have to purposefully search for them. One way to look for trouble (finally something exciting) is to draw mindmaps.

To draw a mindmap, simply start jotting down a word you about a topic. Like 'conference' and give yourself around 4 minutes to jot down everything you can think of related to it. Connect all points and produce new ones as you go. Then draw bubbles around ideas. Write meaningful concepts and conclusions. And find your problem.  

You will clear your mind. And optimize goal achievement in the process. If your problem is to reach the top of a mountain, it is better to consider all paths and choose the best one.

Mindmaps also help you reframe problems to make them play in your favor. You can find actionable problems where there is none. With some creativity, all goals are somehow achievable. Even those that seem too hard.

As the book's motto says: Problem finding + problem solving = well designed life.

# Fear
Fear is a powerful force that can stuck the strongest. Life becomes scary, and action seems meaningless. Yet you can use fear to play in your favor. A free solo climber does that every time. Imminent danger can lead to complete focus.  

It is normal to get scared in front of big challenges. You feel in a danger zone, just as if you were free soloing. We have no control over fear. It just comes. But we have control over the stance in front of that fear.

Fear is stress on steroids. Just as with fear, you can use stress to your advantage. Time keeping tools (and sometimes drugs) act like stressors. Things that greatly energize you. Because your life seems to be at risk. When stressed, I can hold my breath high and focus.

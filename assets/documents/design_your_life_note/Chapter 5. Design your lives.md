# Odysseys
Ok, after the mindmpas and the compass, we hear a call. Now, you can design a life plan that calls you. This is a big adventure. An odyssey. This odyssey can be inspired in a big, long problem. The kind of problem that might take 5 years to solve.

As an exercise, you can design 3 different odysseys. And let's put some constrains over your plans. Set your timeline to be 5 years. Here are some ideas.

Odyssey 1: The thing you do. For me, that would be 'Data scientist for social good'.
Odyssey 2: If suddenly thing 1 was gone. I would be a 'Programmer for a data driven organization like the CCAO'.
Odyssey 3: Money and image don't matter. The crazy 'Mindfulness instructor' for me!.

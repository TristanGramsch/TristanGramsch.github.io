# What is failure immunity?
Failure immunity is to keep going.
Even when you don't get what you want.
Like a PhD in a great university.
Failure immunity allows you to keep flowing even in front of doubt.
You have failed a thousand times.
And no failure in particular has stopped you from trying a new way to get where you design.
Failure immunity is to remember that life is about trying stuff and see from there.  

Keeping track of your mistakes will allow you to calibrate your course. Build a more precise compass.
You can acknowledge your mistakes and move on.

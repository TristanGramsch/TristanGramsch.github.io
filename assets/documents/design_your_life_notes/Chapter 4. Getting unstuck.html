<h2> Stuck </h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
You can feel stuck sometimes. You feel you don't have something to do. Somewhere you belong. There is nothing to work for. If there is, you don't know what to do next to make it happen. You are stuck. It is not a nice feeling. Here, how to get unstuck.

<h3> Get unstuck. Pursue bigger mountains </h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
When you are stuck you can feel as if nothing matters. What's the difference between going about your day and watching a youtube video? Probably none for someone who is stuck. To make things matter, it is useful to find problems. Problems give a reason to action. But problems are not easy to see. You have to purposefully search for them. One way to look for trouble (finally something exciting) is to draw mindmaps.

Follow me on this exercise. Grab your white board or a piece of paper. Write down, in the middle of the board, the first thing that comes to your mind. Like the conference presentation you are supposed to give. Spend around 7 minutes jotting down as many related concepts as you can. Connect all concepts with arrows and drawings. Produce new concepts as you go. Draw bubbles. Get creative. No wrong answers. Write conclusions about your ideas. Find a problem to solve. You will clear your mind. And optimize goal achievement in the process. Mindmaps also help you reframe problems to make them play in your favor. You can find actionable problems where there is none. With some creativity, all goals are somehow achievable. Even those that seem too hard.

As the book's motto says:

Problem finding + problem solving = well designed life.

<h3> Fear </h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
Fear is a powerful force that can stuck the strongest. Life becomes scary, and action seems meaningless. Yet you can use fear to play in your favor. A free solo climber does that every time. Imminent danger can lead to complete focus.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
It is normal to get scared in front of big challenges. You feel in a danger zone, just as if you were free soloing. I believe we have no control over some of the inputs we receive. Some just come. You receive the news that your grandmother passed. You fear you career will be over if you don't complete a project before the deadline. It happens. These imputs produce fear. There is nothing you can do about it. Yet, fear is an opportunity to challenge yourself. To remain calm during rough times. To prove yourself that you can keep focused. That is the warrior spirit. You can reframe fear to work in your favor.

Dysfunctional belief: New experiences might harm me. Reframe: <br>

You can always surpass challenges step by step. From easiest to hardest.

<h1> Prototypes </h1>
Prototypes are a way to test the life you designed. Prototypes allow you to test if your ideas work. If you like them. If they make sense to you. Does it make sense to be a data scientist for social good? Let's try it out. Let's take the very first steps in that direction.

When you are trying to solve a problem, you need data. And usually you don't have a lot of data about your future. Prototyping is a way to sneak up into it.

The book presents us two types of prototypes for life design. Prototype conversations and prototype experiences. Designers make lots of these prototypes. They are constantly trying stuff. Iterating rapidly, and creating momentum. That's the key to a well designed life. To constantly update your reason to action.

A prototype conversation is asking someone you like or admire about their lives. Your life design resembles their life. You seem to want to be like them when you grow up. They are basically your heroes. And you can ask them to tell you more about their lives. How they got where they are. With whom they shared their path. What was the most fulfilling part. What was the hardest.

It is easy to just keep researching about your plan. But That is not going to make it happen. Acting upon it will. This leads us to a dysfunctional belief: Through research of my plan, I'll make it happen. Let's reframe: I should build prototypes to explore questions about my odyssey.

<h2> Brainstorming prototypes </h2>
The book invites us to brainstorm prototype conversations and experiences. Make a list of prototype conversations and a list of prototype experiences. You can follow the instructions below.

- Make a mind map (or many if you need).
- Produce prototypes such that you can say "I have 5 prototypes".
- Rank those prototypes.
- Put a label if you can ("Most exciting", "Dark horse", "If money were no object", etc.)

Finally and most importantly, **build** the prototypes. Actively seek out interviews and experiences.

<h1> What is to happiness? </h1>
I think happiness is the same as flowing. Or to constantly choose well. You can feel good choices. Good choices are engaging and energizing. You feel unstuck.

Happiness also seems to constantly let go of those things you didn't choose. Unhappiness seems to be bad choosing. To constantly pick those things that don't energize and engage you. And to grab on the missed opportunities.

In one word: choose naturally. No wrong answers. Let go of past possibilities. Build from what you have today. Be in this moment. Keep flowing.

You have faced many challenges. Challenges that have been ever harder. You have surpassed them all. Hurray! You are well coursed. Harder and more exciting challenges lie ahead. Go face them.

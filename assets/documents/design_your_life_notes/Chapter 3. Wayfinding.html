<h2> Wayfinding </h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
Ok, so we now know where we are going. Or at least we have a hint on where to go. We suspect that there is a voice calling us. And we want to follow that voice. Personally, whenever I follow the call I feel immense energy running through my body. And I feel engaged in the activities that call me. I have a couple devices that help me keep track of the call of life. The good time activity journal. And the normal journal. These devices have helped me to explore new situations with no fear. When something calls I can try it out and note how much it energizes and engages me.

<h3> Good time journal </h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
The good time journal helps you track activities you perform. And of the energy and engagement they produce. You can find the good time journal <a href = "https://designingyour.life/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DYL-Good-Time-Journal-Activity-Log-v1.1.pdf"> here </a>. After completing 3 sheets of the good time journal, reflect upon it. Here is an example relfection. What energizes and engages me are challenges. Challenges regarding fitness, life design, and programming. People too. People are energizing and easy to interact with. I also realize that I do things that don't energize or engage me. Like watching youtube videos. Or browsing linkedin. These are what I call distractions.

<h3> Normal journal </h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
I recommend you to have a journal. Write it everyday at a given moment. Like right before bed. Track the things you like. From time to time, say every month, read your logs and relfect upon them.

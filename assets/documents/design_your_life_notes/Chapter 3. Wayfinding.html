<h1> Wayfinding </h1>
Ok, so we now know where we are going. Or at least we have a hint on where to go. We suspect that there is a voice calling us. And we want to follow that voice.
<br> <br>
Personally, whenever I follow the call I feel immense energy running through my body. And I feel engaged in the activities that call me.
<br> <br>
We have a couple devices that help us keep track of the call of life. The good time activity journal. And the normal journal.
<br> <br>
These devices have helped me to explore with no fear. When something calls I can try it out and note how much it energizes and engages me.

<h1> Good time journal </h1>
The good time journal helps you track activities you perform. And of the energy and engagement they produce. You can find the good time journal <a href = "https://designingyour.life/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DYL-Good-Time-Journal-Activity-Log-v1.1.pdf"> here </a>

<h1> Good time journal reflection </h1>
After completing 3 sheets of the good time journal, reflect upon it.
<br> <br>
Here is an example relfection. What energizes and engages me are challenges. Challenges regarding fitness, life design, and programming. People too. People are energizing and easy to interact with. I also realize that I do things that don't energize or engage me. Like watching youtube videos. Or browsing linkedin. These are what I call distractions.

<h1> Normal journal </h1>
I recommend you to have a journal. Write it everyday at a given moment. Like right before bed. Track the things you like. Write reflections, say evey month.

<h2> Odysseys </h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
Ok, after the mindmpas and the compass, we hear a call. Now you can design a life plan that calls you. This is a big adventure. An odyssey. This odyssey can be inspired in a big, long problem. The kind of problem that might take 5 years to solve.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
As an exercise, you can design 3 different odysseys. And let's put some constrains over your plans. Set your timeline to be 5 years. Here are some ideas.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
Odyssey 1: The thing you do. For me, that would be 'Data scientist for social good'.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
Odyssey 2: If suddenly thing 1 was gone. I would be a 'Programmer for a data driven organization'.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
Odyssey 3: Money and image don't matter. The crazy 'Mindfulness instructor' for me!.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
Get back to your board. Design three odysseys. Don't pull any punches.

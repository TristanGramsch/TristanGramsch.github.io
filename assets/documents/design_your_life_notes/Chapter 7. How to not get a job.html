<h2> Jobs </h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
The internet is a wonderful place. Yet, the internet's capabilities are not exploited. Job seekers spend months trying to get hired by browsing the internet. They do not get jobs often. Big companies don't care about their flawed hiring systems. They get so many applicants that getting an unproductive worker is uncommon. In the hiring process, the important stuff is left behind. Have you ever seen a job post that asks about work-life coherence? Or that is looking for candidates who believe that good work is found through the proper exercise of their signature strengths? Co-create your dream job.

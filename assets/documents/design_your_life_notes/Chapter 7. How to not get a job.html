The internet is a wonderful place. Hiring managers can reach a huge pool of applicants. Job seekers spend months trying to get hired by browsing the internet. They do not get jobs often. Big companies don't care about their flawed hiring systems. They get so many applicants that getting an unproductive worker is uncommon.

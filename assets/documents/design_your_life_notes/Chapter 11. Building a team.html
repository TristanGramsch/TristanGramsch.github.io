<h1> Team building </h1>
Team and community building are part of life design. These are the people who will be in your life. The ones you co-create your life with. The ones that help you get places. Your intimates. Your networks. Your mentors.

Follow me on this exercise.
1. Make a list of people with whom you can design a life.
2. Make sure they understand how life design goes.
3. Agree to meet regularly and co-create a well designed life as a community.

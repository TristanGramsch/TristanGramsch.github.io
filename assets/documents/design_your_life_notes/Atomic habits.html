<h1> Atomic habits </h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
Here are some reflections on the book 'Atomic Habits' by James Clear. Atomic Habits are a system. A system of progression in areas you find meaningful. This system produces great energy. Hence the word Atomic. Progression happens regularly. Hence the word habit.

After some life design and lots of prototypes, you probably have a solid idea about the things that energize and engage you. It's been a long road of trying stuff and learning (one that, of course, is never ending). You can use habits to explore those things energize and engage you. Overtime, atomic habits compound progress. And fill the skill bars that you have designed for yourself. Personally, I can use Atomic Habits to become a data science master. To become a life design master. And to become highly fit.

A non-atomic habit is the opposite of an atomic habit. Non-atomic habits do not produce energy. Youtube, figthing with loved ones, getting pissed at unimportant stuff, looking at the cellphone. Non-atomic habits hurt in the long run. Yet, I believe one must understand non-atomic habits. Don't inmediately purge them from your life. Non-atomic habits tell you something about yourself. Why do you watch youtube? Why do you get pissed at unimportant stuff? You can hack some non-atomic habits, say, installing an app that prevents you from watching youtube. That is relatively easy. But that doesn't stop different non-atomic habits that might come in the future. The hardest thing is to avoid non-atomic activities. And to keep new non-atomic activities from becoming habits.

Well then, how can one avoid non-atomic activities? I think the answer resides in the call of life. Following the call of life is energizing and engaging. First step, hear the call. Become silent enough to listen to it. I know three tools to become silent. The normal journal, the good time journal, and meditation. When you feel surpassed, return to these tools. Make a habit of them.

Habits are about becoming someone or something. Growing into someone or something. When habits are part of your identity, they come naturally. I am a fit data scientist who designs his life. That is why it is natural to follow the habits that produce this identity. In order to make habits easy, it is best to make them part of your wanted identity.

<h2> What is life design? </h2>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
Life design is a huge toolbox. It's where you get the right words to keep going. Wherever you are going. Life design has allowed me to grow towards the profiles I like. It has allowed me to resemble the people I admire. Some might say life design is a tool of capitalism. That it produces greedy profiles. That might be true. But it can also produce ungreedy profiles. Open source profiles. Or my personal goal: data science for social good. Life design requires time and study. In exchange, life design brings much energy and thrive. It has helped me to flow. It can help you flow as well.

<h2> Where are you? </h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
The first step to life design is to acknowledge where you are. Because we are designing where to go. If you hear voices of criticism, that's ok. And if you feel doubt, that's ok too. People feel doubt often. I know I have. And I am a perfectly productive and healthy member of society. There is nothing wrong with that. Follow me in this exercise. Look around. Breathe deeply. Do you see any of those criticizing voices? Most times, those voices are only in your head. It's relaxing to look around. It's focusing. Feel it.
</p>

<h2> How are you? </h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
Acknowledge how you are. It's a great way to find what you want. And what you want to build. Go ahead and try the categories. You can invent yours as well.

<strong> Play and love. </strong> Play and love are those things that fill you with energy. A joy that is hard to explain. Something that at least I search just because. For me, to play is to explore the world. To explore your body through many exercises. Finding new excitement in every new and harder exercise. And it is also to explore new experiences. Even when they seem crazy! To love is, well, just that. Love is whatever you think it is. No wrong answers.

In a scale from 1 to 12, how are you in terms of play and love?

<strong> Work. </strong> What is work? Great question. I think to work is to build something with other people.
To make a project happen with a community of interested folks. These projects build seniority. They make you experienced. How are you regarding work?

<h1> Mindsets </h1>
What a journey. And its never ending. Keep these 5 designer mindsets in mind.

Radical collaboration: Build your life with others.
Problem finding: Seek problems to solve.
Know it's a process: It will not always work for you.
Try stuff: build tons of prototypes.
Be curious: explore the world you want to grow into.

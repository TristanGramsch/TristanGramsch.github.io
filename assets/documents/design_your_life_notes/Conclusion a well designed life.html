What a journey. And its never ending. Keep these 5 designer mindsets in mind.
<br>
<strong> Radical collaboration</strong>: Build your life with others.
<br>
<strong> Problem finding</strong>: Seek problems to solve.
<br>
<strong> Know it's a process</strong>: It will not always work for you.
<br>
<strong> Try stuff</strong>: build tons of prototypes.
<br>
<strong> Be curious</strong>: explore the world you want to grow into.

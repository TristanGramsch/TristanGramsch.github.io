<h1> Guided life </h1>
Now that we know where we are, it's time to build a device that helps us get somewhere. Where exactly? Wherever you design. Follow the call of life. Let it take over. If you don't know what calls you, this compass will help you find it.

<h2> Compass </h2>
A compass is simply a few words on where you want to be. And who you want to become.

<h2> Worklife </h2>
Worklife is a holistic integration of work and life. It is what you do in any given day. It is a combination of how you bring food to the table. And everything else you do. Think about yourself. Do you like your work? Do you like your life?

Follow me on this exercise. Get to a big white board or big piece of paper. The more space the better. Jot down all the things you want to add to your worklife. And all the things you want to remove. Do you want to answer less emails? Jot it down. Do you want to go out more? Go ahead. This is the worklife that is calling you. The one you wish you had. It is possible to design a path to it.

<h2> Guided life </h2>

Now that we know where we are, it's time to build a device that helps us get somewhere. Where exactly? Wherever you think the call of life is. Follow it. Let it take over. If you don't know what calls you, this compass will help you find it.

<h3> Compass </h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px;">
A compass is simply a few words on where you want to be. And who you want to become. Let's think about your life and your work. Do you like your work? Do you like your life? Can you think of ways of making it better? Less stresseful or more joyful? Follow me on this exercise. Get to a big white board or big piece of paper. The more space the better. Jot down all the things you want to add to your worklife. And all the things you want to remove. Do you want to answer less emails? Jot it down. Do you want to go out more? Write it. This is the worklife that is calling you. The one you wish you had. It is possible to design a path to it.

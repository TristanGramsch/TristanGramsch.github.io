# **About me**

Hi, I am **{{ site.author.name }}**, <br>

I am a data scientist for social good.
I have found a big mountain.
To end hate against drugs.
Drugs are not a monster.
Just chemical structures.
Well developed institutions treat drugs as if it was a monster.
Shaming drug users.
Patronizing people.
We deserve better.
We deserve more transparency.
Better explanations.
Better data architecture.
Better repositories.
Clear accessible knowledge to drugs.
What they are.
What they cause.
Why.
It's seems the best way to fight stigma.
To fully know the monster.

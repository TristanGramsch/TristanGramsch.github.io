Welcome,

<font size="+1">
I am Trist√°n, a data scientist.
Meaning that I both do machine learning and data architecture development.
This is what I know most about.
<br>
I am also into health economics.
I know plenty about the overdose epidemic that currently affects the US.
And I have written plenty about social ties among drug users.
<br>
Feel free to explore the content of this webpage.
It is designed to share the things I find interesting.
To show what I find beautiful.

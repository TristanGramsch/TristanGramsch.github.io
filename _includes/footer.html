<!-- Footer is a piece of text at the bottom of every page
It contains my name.
It contains social.html, which renders a list of social media I use.
It used to contain the footer sideways.
Here we use liquid to define variables.
And include those variables in the web page.
Then, we use liquid again to include social.html

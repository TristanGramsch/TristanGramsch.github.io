Drugs are something people don't understand.
<br> Few have sat to actually think what drugs are.
<br> What they can do.
<br> Where they can be found.
<br> Why people consume them.
<br> When people consume them.
<br> Our intention is to solve the overdose epidemic.
<br> That unfathomably big problem.
<br> That has as many aspects as people can think of.
<br> Let's face that.
<br> Even though we cannot see it completely clear.
<br> We know rehab cannot solve the epidemic.
<br> Rehab doesn't prevent people's despair.
<br> It doesn't prevent overdose.
<br> What we have is a huge adventure ahead.
<br> To make sense of this.
<br> To see it with kindness.
<br> To see it as unproblematic.
<br> So that we can come with a more intuitive solution

<br> Treating something with such wonder will attract others.
People might get curious.
They might want to take a peak at drugs as unproblematic.
They will understand it better.
We will understand it better.  
<br> Drugs are not a monster.
Just chemical structures.
Well developed institutions treat drugs as if it was a monster.
Shaming drug users.
Patronizing people.
We deserve better.
We deserve more transparency.
Better explanations.
Better data architecture.
Better repositories.
Clear accessible knowledge to drugs.
What they are.
What they cause.
Why.
It's seems the best way to fight the overdose epidemic.
To fully know the monster.

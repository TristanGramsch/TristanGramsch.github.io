Drugs are something people don't understand.
<br> Few have sat to actually think what drugs are.
<br> What they can do.
<br> Where they can be found.
<br> Why people consume them.
<br> When people consume them.
<br>
Our intention is to solve the drug problem.
<br> That unfathomably, big problem.
<br> That has as many aspects as people can think of.
<br> Let's face that.
<br> Even though we don't clearly know what it is.
<br>
We know what will not solve it.
<br> Stigma reduction.
<br> We don't even know what stigma is.
<br> How stigma for some is not stigma for others.
<br> How the most honest efforts lead to unexpected unwanted consequences.
<br>
We also know rehab doesn't fix the problem.
<br> It doesn't prevent people's despair.
<br> It doesn't prevent overdose.
<br>
What we have is a huge adventure ahead.
<br> To make sense of this.
<br> To see it with kindness.
<br> To see it as unproblematic.
<br> As if it was beautiful math theorem.
<br>
Treating something with such wonder will attract others.
People might get curious.
They might want to take a peak at drugs as unproblematic.
They will understand it better.
We will understand it better.
